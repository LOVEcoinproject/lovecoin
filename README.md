LoveCoin (LOVE)

LOVEcoin is a coin aimed at getting the world in love with crypto. Our long term goal is to educate people about how crypto is better than fiat and why they should love us. We will invest the money raised from the IPO in promoting LOVEcoin in those parts of the world where cryptos are not very popular and where we cannot reach via bitcointalk. This will be our main focus and we will obviously not leave out all the lovely people already involved in the crypto world. Love Never Fails.
